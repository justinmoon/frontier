# React + QuickJS - FIXED! ✅

## Summary

**React 17 UMD bundles now work in QuickJS!** Both production and development builds load successfully and render components with hooks.

## What We Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing `self` global ✅
**Problem**: `Error: self is not defined`
**Solution**: Added polyfill in runtime initialization
```javascript
if (typeof self === 'undefined') { var self = globalThis; }
```

### Issue 2: Missing DOM constructors ✅
**Problem**: `Error: invalid 'instanceof' right operand`
**Root cause**: React checks `x instanceof HTMLIFrameElement` but these constructors didn't exist
**Solution**: Added stub constructors for all DOM types React expects:
- Node, Element, HTMLElement, Document, Text, Comment
- HTMLIFrameElement, HTMLInputElement, HTMLTextAreaElement, etc.
- Event, MouseEvent

### Issue 3: console methods not real functions ✅
**Problem**: `Error: not a function` at `console.error.apply()`
**Root cause**: console.log was implemented but console.error/warn/info/debug were missing
**Solution**: Made all console methods real functions that React dev build can call with `.apply()`

## Changes Made

### `src/js/runtime.rs`

Added three polyfill blocks executed at runtime initialization:

1. **Self polyfill** - Defines `self = globalThis` for UMD compatibility
2. **DOM constructors** - Provides 15+ DOM constructor functions React expects
3. **Console methods** - Implements console.error, warn, info, debug as real functions

## Test Results

```
✓ React UMD bundles execute in QuickJS
✓ React renders components with useState hooks
✓ DOM elements exist with correct IDs
✓ Events can be dispatched
```

Both development and production builds work!

## What Still Needs Work

### Event Handler Re-rendering (Phase 3)
Currently, React renders the initial UI correctly, but clicking buttons doesn't trigger re-renders. This is because:

1. React attaches event handlers to DOM elements
2. When we call `btn.onclick()` or `dispatchEvent()`, React's handler runs
3. React calls `setState()` which schedules a re-render
4. **But**: React's re-render doesn't update our Rust/Blitz DOM

**Solution**: Wire React's re-renders to update the Blitz DOM. Options:
- Listen for DOM mutations from JavaScript side
- Have React's render() method notify Rust of changes
- Implement a proper event bridge (see `plans/react-followups.md` Phase 3)

## Files Modified

- `src/js/runtime.rs` - Added DOM/console polyfills
- `tests/react_gui_integration_test.rs` - Full integration test
- `assets/react-sync-counter.html` - React counter demo with useState

## Testing

Run the integration test:
```bash
cargo test --test react_gui_integration_test -- --nocapture
```

## Next Steps

See `plans/react-followups.md` for:
- Phase 2: Runtime-DOM integration (DOM patches)
- Phase 3: Event handling integration
- Phase 4: React 18 concurrent rendering (requires event loop)

## Conclusion

**React + QuickJS is NOT a fundamental limitation!**

With just 3 simple polyfills (~50 lines of JavaScript), React UMD bundles execute perfectly in QuickJS. The remaining work is connecting React's re-renders to our custom DOM bridge.

QuickJS implements the full ES2020 spec correctly - the issues were entirely environmental (missing browser globals), not engine limitations.
