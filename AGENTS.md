# Agents Guide

NO MOCKS. NO FAKE CODE.

Our goal here is to build a new web browser that keeps the best of the dying old web -- html, css, typescript -- and abandons the rest -- particularly centralized 3rd parties like DNS and certificate authorities. We also want to make it nostr-native: every user gets a private key, bitcoin payments are first-class citizens, and the browser itself can implement the hard parts of interacting with relays as web apis: like ingesting relevant notes for a timeline-style event, or saving notes locally, or implementing e2ee messenging like Marmot (~/code/marmot). Lastly, we want to add obvious things that web browsers should have but don't: native typescript support and proper embedded databases like SQLite.

Keep things simple. Try to keep directory structure reasonably flat.

Never stub things out for a real implementation later unless you are explicitely told to do so. Your job is to make a real implementation now.

**NEVER USE MOCKS.** Mocks hide bugs by not exercising real code paths. If absolutely needed, we can have variants of tests that run faster by mocking or just doing unittests -- but our main ci test suite that runs on every PR _must_ run all important tests against real infrastructure where possible to ensure our app works in the wild.

When you're developing a feature that effects the ui, try to create a UI test using blitz's accessibility feautures. This can help give you a feedback loop. Without a feedback loop you struggle to deliver working features because you can't interact with your work.

**`just ci` MUST PASS** before any feature or change is considered complete. The agent must iterate on the code and get all CI checks passing. This includes:

When you write e2e/ui tests, only interact with the app by taking actions that users can: typing or clicking on screen. Don't call internal API's like `submit_form()` or `replace_document()`. This isn't e2e / ui test because users don't do these actions. It's cheating.

When you see "Exception generated by QuickJS" you need to figure out what caused it. Don't just assume "oh quickjs doesn't support what i'm doing".

You are in charge of QA! Don't ask me to QA for you!
